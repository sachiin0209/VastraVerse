            <strong>Origin and History:</strong><br>
            Bharatanatyam originated over 2,000 years ago in Tamil Nadu. It was traditionally performed in Hindu temples and royal courts by Devadasis (temple dancers). After falling into disrepute during colonial times, it was revived in the 20th century and is now recognized as one of India's eight classical dance forms.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            <strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
            Characterized by bent knees (aramandi), precise hand gestures (mudras), elaborate footwork, and expressive facial movements (abhinaya). The dance represents a perfect balance of nritta (rhythmic dance movements), nritya (expression), and natya (dramatic elements).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cultural Significance:</strong><br>

            <strong>Origin and History:</strong><br>
            Kathakali originated in Kerala during the 17th century, evolving from earlier temple art forms like Koodiyattam. Its name combines "katha" (story) and "kali" (play). It gained royal patronage from the kingdom of Kottarakkara and has since been preserved as a crucial cultural tradition.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            <strong>Key Features:</strong><br>

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cultural Significance:</strong><br>
            Kathakali primarily depicts stories from Hindu epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana. It represents a complete art form combining dance, drama, music, and literature.

      Madhubani painting originated in Bihar's Mithila region, dating back to the Ramayana era when King Janaka commissioned artists to document his daughter Sita's wedding. Traditionally created by women on mud walls during festivals, it transitioned to paper in the 1960s during a famine to generate income.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      <strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
      Characterized by vibrant colors, geometric patterns, and nature-inspired motifs. Artists use natural dyes and tools like twigs, fingers, and nib pens.
